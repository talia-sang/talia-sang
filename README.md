- [Chorus]
Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes, we can!

Working together, they get the job done

Bob the Builder!
Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes, we can!

Pilchard and Bird, Travis and Spud
Playing together like good friends should

Can we fix it?
Bob the Builder!
Yes, we can!

##SHIMMER AND SHINE
 Two genies in a bottle, up in the starry sky
It's Shimmer and Shine (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
On a magical ride (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Boom Zahramay, oh, what a day
They're genies divine
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
Exploring new places, sparkling bright
Colorful wonders, oh, what a sight
There's magic, there's friendships, adventures for all
So much to discover in Zahramay Falls
Shimmer and Shine (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
On a magical ride (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Boom Zahramay, oh, what a day
They're genies divine
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
On a genie carpet, look how they fly
Leaving trails of glitter in Zahramay skies
Zooming together up in the clouds
The stars are all glowing with friends all around
Shimmer and Shine (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
On a magical ride (oh-oh-oh)
Boom Zahramay
Oh, what a day, they're genies divine
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
Boom, boom, boom
It's Shimmer, it's Shimmer
Boom, boom, boom
It's Shine, Shine
Boom, boom, boom
They glimmer, they glimmer
Boom, boom, boom
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
Shimmer and Shine (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
On a magical ride (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Boom Zahramay, oh, what a day
They're genies divine
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
Shimmer and Shine (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
On a magical ride (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Boom Zahramay, oh, what a day
They're genies divine
It's Shimmer and Shine, Shimmer and Shine
